# Transcription code review

The useful boundary is the existing `TranscriptionEngine`, not a provider registry. The editor needs finalized text, replacement interim text, activity and lifecycle callbacks. Provider credentials, audio encoding, transport and wire events belong to adapters.

## Changes made in this review

- Grouped browser OpenAI transport, transcript ordering, protocol and diagnostics under `src/shares/transcription/providers/openai/`.
- Removed the hook's direct OpenAI dependency. `transcription/provider.ts` selects the factory; hook options name the engine override and Stop callback instead of requiring a positional `undefined` argument.
- Grouped server OpenAI issuance, cleanup, credentials and diagnostics under `src/shares/server/providers/openai/`. Shared SDK construction now owns key resolution, disabled SDK logging and retries; operations retain separate deadlines. Environment variable names and Amplify secret lookup are unchanged.
- Separated HTTP access checks from provider session creation. Text cleanup has its own selection module, so switching speech providers need not replace paragraph cleanup.
- Consolidated the two identical burst guards, retaining separate operation buckets and existing limits.
- Extracted bounded OpenAI frame processing and commit accounting from resource lifetime. Repeated acknowledgements for one item no longer settle another outstanding commit.
- Made disposal terminal even before an engine starts. Disposed capability probes cannot later acquire a microphone.

## Replacing transcription

1. Implement `TranscriptionEngine` in `transcription/providers/<provider>/`. Keep transport and provider SDK calls there. Reuse microphone helpers when useful; a provider SDK can own capture instead if its cleanup guarantees are tested.
2. Emit interim as the complete current provisional string, not a delta. Emit each finalized segment exactly once, in audio order, without replaying earlier finals. The hook appends finals and enforces the draft limit. Provider adapters must deduplicate/reorder their own events.
3. `start` must begin acquisition only after the user's explicit action. `stop` stops microphone tracks immediately but allows trailing finals before `ended`. `dispose` cancels pending work, releases all resources and silences callbacks permanently. Errors must use authored, safe messages and preserve already emitted finals. One instance represents one session.
4. Select the adapter in `transcription/provider.ts`. Select its matching server issuer and redacted diagnostics in `server/transcription-provider.ts`. The current credential endpoint returns `{ value, expires_at }`; adapt that endpoint's schema and client parser together if the next provider needs different connection data. Do not force every provider into OpenAI's credential format.
5. Keep permanent keys in server-only configuration. Prefer short-lived browser credentials when supported. A provider that requires a proxy will need a transport compatible with Amplify; changing the factory alone cannot supply that infrastructure.
6. Leave `server/cleanup-provider.ts` alone to retain OpenAI text cleanup. Update deployment/retention/cost docs for the new speech provider and run the contract scenarios and browser suite before comparing costs on devices.

No runtime provider setting, registry, fallback transcript, or multi-provider reconciliation was added. A code-level switch is sufficient for the next experiment.

| High                      | Each successful Stop cleans the entire growing draft again. Repeated short sessions repeatedly bill for and rewrite earlier text, including edits.                                                | Decide whether cleanup should process only new segments or explicitly selected text. Preserve previous edits and paragraph boundaries; measure quality before changing behavior.   |
| High before public access | Burst limits and share storage are process-local. They are neither a distributed spend quota nor durable storage across Amplify instances/restarts.                                               | Keep preview access protected. Before public use, add shared storage and an enforced shared budget/rate boundary appropriate to deployment.                                        |
| Medium                    | The engine still coordinates several lifecycle flags, deadlines and browser resources. Cancellation guards are essential; removing them would reintroduce stale callbacks and leaked microphones. | Consider a single internal phase model when changing transport. Keep the generic hook's draft lifecycle separate from provider connection state.                                   |
| Medium                    | Local RMS/silence detection is a simple amplitude gate, not robust speech detection. Background noise and quiet speech can affect turn boundaries.                                                | Compare supported provider turn detection or a proven VAD only if device tests show a problem; avoid adding a large audio pipeline preemptively.                                   |
| Medium                    | Cleanup is a probabilistic rewrite even with structured output. Schema validation cannot prove meaning was preserved.                                                                             | Keep explicit review/save and original-on-failure behavior. Add a small manual evaluation set for negations, recovery language, repetition and names when changing prompts/models. |

## Libraries versus custom code

The official OpenAI SDK already replaces hand-written server request, response and structured-output plumbing. The AWS SDK handles compute-role credentials and Secrets Manager. Existing Zod schemas enforce cleanup/text bounds. These are good dependencies to keep.

The installed OpenAI SDK also includes `OpenAIRealtimeWebRTC` from `openai/realtime/webrtc`. Its declarations expose connection deadlines, cancellation, typed events and resource closure while leaving microphone tracks and SDP HTTP exchange to the app. This is a concrete candidate to replace native connection/channel bookkeeping in a separate transport change. It does **not** eliminate transcript ordering, deduplication, Stop draining, local activity detection or microphone cleanup. This review retains the working transport and its mocked browser coverage rather than mixing a transport migration into provider separation. No claim of live validation of that helper is made.

A query cache, state-machine package, agent framework or generic provider plugin system would add machinery for one cancellable session and one cancellable cleanup request. They are not justified at this size. Do not remove bounded buffers, generation checks, aborts or finalization deadlines merely to reduce line count.
