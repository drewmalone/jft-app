# Doorknob v0.2

Doorknob is a mobile-first recovery reflection app. Read a daily reflection, write a text share, save it privately through the Next.js Backend for Frontend (BFF), and revisit past shares.

## Getting started

Use Node.js **24 LTS**, pinned in `.nvmrc`:

```bash
nvm use
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000. Local development needs no credentials: a random session signing secret is generated for the running process. Optionally set `SESSION_SECRET` to a random value of at least 32 bytes in `.env.local`. Never commit secrets or personal recovery text.

For a production-mode local run, create `.env.local` first:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('node:crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Copy the generated value into `.env.local` as `SESSION_SECRET=<generated value>`, then run:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Production requires this secret and sets Secure cookies. Missing or short production secrets cause API requests to return a generic 500; the app does not supply a production fallback. A signing-key change invalidates existing cookies. Use HTTPS when hosting; browser handling of Secure cookies on plain HTTP localhost can vary. Use `npm run dev` for ordinary local development.

## Writing and reviewing shares

1. Read the reflection and write in the multiline textbox.
2. Choose **Save privately**. Confirmation appears only after the server saves your text.
3. Open **Past shares** to browse newest first, then select an entry to fetch and read it in full.

Blank shares cannot be saved. Navigating between views preserves drafts. Failed saves retain your words and show an error. Pending saves disable editing and duplicate submissions. History and detail requests have loading and error feedback; failed history requests can be retried.

The reading and April 23, 2025 date remain deliberate placeholders.

## Persistence and privacy limitations

Shares are sent to the same-origin Next.js server and stored in a process-local Map. Each record has a server-generated UUID, ISO timestamp, `kind: 'text'`, text, reading snapshot, and anonymous owner ID in the server record. Share JSON omits the ownerId field. There is no browser storage persistence or migration of v0.1 test data.

A signed, HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax cookie identifies the anonymous session. It expires after 30 days and is Secure in production. Different browser sessions cannot list or read one another's shares. Invalid or expired credentials receive 401. Clear site cookies to start a fresh session if this occurs; **clearing cookies loses access to existing shares**, even while those records remain in server memory. The signed cookie is readable, not encrypted, and must be treated as a bearer credential. Tabs sharing site cookies share an owner; use separate profiles/cookie jars to test isolation. Cookies do not provide login accounts or recovery.

**This storage is for local development. Restarting the server clears all shares. Multiple processes, replicas, and serverless instances such as Vercel do not share the Map and cannot provide reliable persistence.** No disk storage, database, encryption at rest, backup, account recovery, or durable deployment is provided. Unsaved drafts live only in React memory and disappear on refresh. The development signing secret also resets on process restart unless configured. There is no per-share deletion or expiry job; cookie loss does not remove records from the running Map. See [the data lifecycle](docs/DATA_GLOSSARY.md#app-data-lifecycle).

No public sharing links, audio, transcription, AI, registration, real reading feeds, or harness integration are included.

## Validation

```bash
npm run check
PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium npm run test:e2e
```

`check` runs formatting, lint, Node tests, and a production build including TypeScript validation. Browser tests run separately against a production server on port 3100 with a synthetic signing secret. All test content is fictional. If Chromium is not installed:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

Omit `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH` when using Playwright's installed browser. Tests cover API validation and metadata, ownership/session credential checks, save/reload/detail flows, ordering, API failures, draft retention, duplicate prevention, loading, and empty history in mobile and desktop Chromium.

Manual checks:

1. Confirm blank text cannot be saved. Navigate between views and confirm an unfinished draft remains.
2. Save a multiline share, refresh, and reopen it from **Past shares**.
3. Open a separate private browser session and confirm its history is empty and the first session's share ID returns 404.
4. Simulate a failed POST in browser developer tools; verify the draft remains with no confirmation.
5. Check phone and desktop layouts, keyboard navigation, and heading focus.
6. Restart the server and confirm history is empty. Clear cookies and confirm previous shares are inaccessible.

## Installation troubleshooting

This project uses public npm packages and does not require npm login. For E401 on a machine configured for a private company registry, try `npm ci --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/`. Fix installation errors before starting the app. Do not commit registry credentials or change shared company authentication.
