# Doorknob v0.3

Doorknob is a mobile-first recovery reflection app. Read a daily reflection, write a text share, save it privately through the Next.js Backend for Frontend (BFF), revisit past shares, and intentionally send an expiring signed reading link to another person.

## Getting started

Use Node.js **24 LTS**, pinned in `.nvmrc`:

```bash
nvm use
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000. Local development needs no credentials: a random session signing secret is generated for the running process. Optionally set `SESSION_SECRET` to a random value of at least 32 bytes in `.env.local`. Never commit secrets or personal recovery text.

For a production-mode local run, create `.env.local` first:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('node:crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Copy the generated value into `.env.local` as `SESSION_SECRET=<generated value>`, then run:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Production requires both `SESSION_SECRET` and a separate `SHARE_LINK_SECRET` and sets Secure cookies. Generate a second independent random value with the same command and add `SHARE_LINK_SECRET=<second generated value>` to `.env.local` before starting. Missing or short production secrets cause API requests to return a generic 500; the app does not supply a production fallback. A signing-key change invalidates existing cookies. Use HTTPS when hosting; browser handling of Secure cookies on plain HTTP localhost can vary. Use `npm run dev` for ordinary local development.

## Sharing with another person

Save a share, then tap **Share** beneath your thoughts on the card. It opens the device's share sheet directly. Browsers without native sharing copy the link; if clipboard access is unavailable, a small selectable link field appears. The same button and share icon are available in past-share details. Saving prepares the URL but never sends it to anyone.

Recipients can read the original reading and thoughts without an account. They cannot browse the sender's history. Production requires an independent random `SHARE_LINK_SECRET` of at least 32 bytes, separate from `SESSION_SECRET`; development generates one per process. Never log signed URLs. Technical lifetime and storage details are in [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#signed-sharing-boundary).

### Manual check across two browser sessions

1. Run `npm run dev`, write fictional text, and **Save privately** in browser A.
2. Tap the share icon. Confirm it opens native sharing or copies the link directly. If both APIs are unavailable, copy from the fallback field.
3. Open the link in a fresh private browser B. Confirm the original reading and written thoughts appear without a login or session cookie.
4. In B, the home page's **Past shares** is empty and the sender's private detail returns 404.
5. In A, open the entry from **Past shares** and tap its icon; it uses the same URL without requesting a new link.
6. Tamper with a URL parameter and confirm the recipient page says **This share is unavailable**. Restart the server and confirm its in-memory shares are gone.

## Writing and reviewing shares

1. Read the reflection and write in the multiline textbox.
2. Choose **Save privately**. Confirmation appears only after the server saves your text.
3. Open **Past shares** to browse newest first, then select an entry to fetch and read it in full.

Blank shares cannot be saved. Text is limited to 10,000 Unicode code points, and the full JSON request is limited to 64 KiB. Oversized-input failures retain the draft for editing. Navigating between views preserves drafts. Failed saves retain your words and show an error. Pending saves disable editing and duplicate submissions. History and detail requests have loading and error feedback; failed history requests can be retried.

The reading and April 23, 2025 date remain deliberate placeholders.

## Persistence and privacy limitations

Shares are sent to the same-origin Next.js server and stored in a process-local Map. Each record has a server-generated UUID, ISO timestamp, `kind: 'text'`, text, reading snapshot, and anonymous owner ID in the server record. Share JSON omits the ownerId field. There is no browser storage persistence or migration of v0.1 test data.

A signed, HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax cookie identifies the anonymous session. It expires after 30 days and is Secure in production. Different browser sessions cannot list or read one another's shares through the private endpoints; an intentionally shared signed link separately grants read access to that share. Missing, invalid or expired cookies automatically start a fresh empty anonymous session. This is disposable prototype behavior: old ownership is never restored from invalid credentials, and previous records may remain in server memory but are inaccessible to the new owner. The signed cookie is readable, not encrypted, and must be treated as a bearer credential. Tabs sharing site cookies share an owner; use separate profiles/cookie jars to test isolation. Cookies do not provide login accounts or recovery. Saving waits for a successful initial session read; initialization failures retain the draft and offer retry. Foreign-origin POSTs are rejected before session creation and never replace the cookie. This prototype now uses Hono’s signed-cookie format; old-format cookies automatically start a fresh empty session. There is no cookie migration.

**This storage is for local development. Restarting the server clears all shares. Multiple processes, replicas, and serverless instances such as Vercel do not share the Map and cannot provide reliable persistence.** No disk storage, database, encryption at rest, backup, account recovery, or durable deployment is provided. Unsaved drafts live only in React memory and disappear on refresh. The development signing secret also resets on process restart unless configured. There is no per-share deletion or expiry job; cookie loss does not remove records from the running Map. See [the data lifecycle](docs/DATA_GLOSSARY.md#app-data-lifecycle).

Signed sharing links are optional: saving prepares a URL but never sends it automatically. No audio, transcription, AI, registration, real reading feeds, or harness integration are included.

## Validation

```bash
npm run check
PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium npm run test:e2e
```

`check` runs formatting, lint, Node tests, and a production build including TypeScript validation. Browser tests run separately against a production server on port 3100 with a synthetic signing secret. All test content is fictional. If Chromium is not installed:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

Omit `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH` when using Playwright's installed browser. Tests validate the generated OpenAPI document and actual responses with Swagger Parser and Ajv. They cover HTTP headers/methods, stable error codes, input-size boundaries, API validation and metadata, ownership/session credential checks, save/reload/detail flows, ordering, API failures, draft retention, duplicate prevention, loading, and empty history in mobile and desktop Chromium.

Manual checks:

1. Confirm blank text cannot be saved. Navigate between views and confirm an unfinished draft remains.
2. Save a multiline share, refresh, and reopen it from **Past shares**.
3. Open a separate private browser session and confirm its history is empty and the first session's share ID returns 404.
4. Simulate a failed POST in browser developer tools; verify the draft remains with no confirmation.
5. Check phone and desktop layouts, keyboard navigation, and heading focus.
6. Restart the server and confirm history is empty. Clear cookies and confirm previous shares are inaccessible.

Open http://localhost:3000/api/openapi.json for the generated contract. TypeScript route/Zod definitions are the source of truth. `npm run openapi:lint` generates ignored `.tmp/openapi.yaml` and checks it with Spectral; CI also uploads the YAML as the `openapi` workflow artifact. Generated YAML is not committed.

## Installation troubleshooting

This project uses public npm packages and does not require npm login. For E401 on a machine configured for a private company registry, try `npm ci --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/`. Fix installation errors before starting the app. Do not commit registry credentials or change shared company authentication.
