# Application infrastructure

This single root/state manages the shares table, its owner/time index, the Amplify SSR compute role, and optional Soniox secret metadata/access. No application or Amplify branch is created. Bootstrap state separately, then review and apply this root manually. GitHub Actions validates and tests Terraform; merging code does not provision resources.

## Configuration

Set the resource/state region once and select the appropriate temporary-credential profile:

```bash
export AWS_REGION=us-west-2
export AWS_PROFILE=doorknob-dev
```

The AWS providers and S3 backend use `AWS_REGION`, or the profile's region when unset. If state intentionally lives elsewhere, initialize with `-backend-config=region=STATE_BUCKET_REGION`. Backends cannot reference Terraform input variables.

`environments/soniox-dev.tfvars` and `soniox-prod.tfvars` explicitly select `project_name`, `environment` and `create_soniox_secret`. Additional optional values belong in ignored `*.local.tfvars` files:

```hcl
# Reuse an existing secret instead of creating its metadata:
create_soniox_secret      = false
stt_soniox_secret_arn     = "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:existing-soniox-REPLACE"
```

The root manages exactly one SSR compute role, `${project_name}-${environment}-ssr-compute`. Persistence, OpenAI cleanup and optional Soniox permissions all attach to it; `compute_role_arn` is the role to associate with the trusted Amplify branch. If that role already exists, import it into `aws_iam_role.compute` in this same state before applying. There is no separate speech-role override. Review existing policies before adopting a role; never apply competing Terraform states to the same resource.

## Account, secret and permissions

1. Create separate Soniox dev/prod projects/keys with billing and usage monitoring. Restrict each key to **Temporary API keys** and **Speech-to-text, real-time** (`transcribe_websocket`); omit unrelated products. Check [current permissions documentation](https://docs.soniox.com/authentication/api-key-permissions).
2. By explicit environment choice, Terraform creates metadata for `${project_name}-${environment}-soniox-api-key`, using default tags and AWS-managed encryption. It creates no secret version and reads no value into state. Alternatively, reference one existing ARN. Creating and referencing simultaneously fails; disabling creation without an ARN omits Soniox access.
3. After reviewed apply, populate the **plain-string** value separately using Secrets Manager's secure console editor. Never pass keys as Terraform arguments, variables, outputs, shell history, committed files or build settings.
4. The inline Soniox policy grants only `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` on the configured secret. It does not replace existing role policies or manage OpenAI access. OpenAI cleanup permission belongs to the existing deployment/persistence infrastructure ; retain that grant exactly once. Customer-managed KMS secrets additionally require a separately reviewed exact-key `kms:Decrypt` grant and key policy.

No static AWS keys are used. The runtime AWS SDK uses the compute-role credential chain. The shared secret loader caches successful reads for five minutes per process/ARN; restart for immediate rotation pickup.

## Bootstrap remote state once per environment

`bootstrap/` creates a private, encrypted, versioned S3 bucket with TLS-only access, public access blocked and destruction protection. If already managed, reuse its bootstrap state and bucket. Bootstrap state starts in protected local storage outside Git.

```bash
export TF_DATA_DIR="$PWD/.tmp/bootstrap-dev"
terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/bootstrap init
terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/bootstrap plan -var=environment=dev -var=bucket_name=REPLACE-WITH-UNIQUE-DEV-BUCKET -state="$PWD/.tmp/bootstrap-dev.tfstate" -out=bootstrap-dev.tfplan
# Operator reviews the account, region, bucket and plan before applying.
terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/bootstrap apply -state="$PWD/.tmp/bootstrap-dev.tfstate" bootstrap-dev.tfplan
```

Copy `environments/dev.s3.tfbackend.example` to its ignored matching backend file and supply the actual bucket. Production uses its own profile, bucket/backend key, data directory and variables. Native S3 locking requires no lock table. State operators need scoped S3 key/prefix access, including Get/Put/Delete on `.tflock`; routine state deletion is unnecessary. Commit provider lockfiles, never state, plans or credentials.

## Validate, review and apply manually

Credential-free checks include mocked-provider tests:

```bash
terraform -chdir=infra/terraform fmt -check -recursive
terraform -chdir=infra/terraform init -backend=false -input=false
terraform -chdir=infra/terraform validate
terraform -chdir=infra/terraform test
terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/bootstrap init -backend=false -input=false
terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/bootstrap validate
```

For a deployment, initialize the selected remote backend and inspect a saved plan:

```bash
export TF_DATA_DIR="$PWD/.tmp/terraform-dev"
terraform -chdir=infra/terraform init -reconfigure -backend-config=environments/dev.s3.tfbackend
terraform -chdir=infra/terraform plan -var-file=environments/dev.tfvars -var-file=environments/dev.local.tfvars -out=dev.tfplan
# Operator reviews exact account, environment, resources and permissions.
terraform -chdir=infra/terraform apply dev.tfplan
terraform -chdir=infra/terraform output stt_soniox_secret_arn
```

Omit the local var file if unnecessary. Use matching prod files/profile/data directory for production. Keep saved plans private and remove them afterward. CI performs validation only, never automatic apply.

## Amplify runtime and rollout

Associate the existing role only with the intended trusted branch, using the console or a manually reviewed command:

```bash
aws amplify update-branch --app-id REPLACE_APP_ID --branch-name REPLACE_TRUSTED_BRANCH --compute-role-arn REPLACE_ROLE_ARN
```

Use the `compute_role_arn` output for that association. The operator needs scoped `amplify:UpdateBranch` and `iam:PassRole`; runtime code gets neither. Do not make a secret-capable role an app-wide default for untrusted previews. The build service role is distinct from the SSR compute role.

Set server-only runtime settings `STT_ENABLED=true`, `STT_PROVIDER=soniox`, `STT_SONIOX_SECRET_ARN=<output ARN>` and the existing `STT_OPENAI_SECRET_ARN` for cleanup. Preserve stable session signing and existing application permissions. Run `node --import tsx scripts/prepare-runtime-env.ts` from the repository root before `npm run build`; it edits only allowlisted non-secret assignments in `.env.production` and preserves unrelated source using dotenvx's source editor. Permanent API keys must not enter Amplify build variables/artifacts. `STT_SONIOX_API_KEY` is local-only and ignored in production.

Use [the runtime guide](../../docs/TRANSCRIPTION.md) for application configuration, token/lifecycle behavior and physical-device/provider release checks. Neither local validation nor a code merge establishes a live AWS deployment or live transcription test.

## Costs, monitoring and rollback

Consult current Soniox audio pricing. Secrets Manager adds per-secret/month and request charges; state S3 adds storage/version/request costs. Existing Amplify and OpenAI cleanup charges continue. Monitor issuance counts, failures, concurrency and provider usage without logging speech or credentials. Anonymous cookies/process-local limits are insufficient for public spending protection; distributed quotas, concurrency/abuse controls and provider controls are required. Alerts may not stop spending. Review provider retention independently from application storage policy.

To switch speech back, set `STT_PROVIDER=openai`, retain its independent credentials/permission, rebuild/redeploy and reload clients. Cleanup already uses OpenAI. Set `STT_ENABLED=false` to disable both paid operations. Already issued Soniox keys can connect during their 60-second lifetime; active streams have the ten-minute cap. For incident response, verify the provider's revocation semantics before relying on parent-key revocation to stop active streams.

Keep secret metadata and shared role/state resources during rollback. Managed secrets have `prevent_destroy` and a 30-day recovery window; changing creation to false intentionally blocks accidental deletion. Removing metadata or rotating live keys requires a separate reviewed operator action. No application persistence resources should change in a speech rollback.

## Persistence and retention

Choose matching `environments/dev.tfvars` or `prod.tfvars`, backend, profile and data directory. Set `create_soniox_secret` deliberately, or pass an existing ARN in a private local var file. Preserve/import existing managed role/table resources into this same state before applying; never apply the speech and persistence snapshots as separate stacks. The output `runtime_environment` supplies `SHARE_PERSISTENCE=dynamodb`, `DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME` and `DYNAMODB_REGION`.

Run `node --import tsx scripts/prepare-runtime-env.ts` once before `npm run build`. It validates persistence and speech settings before changing `.env.production`, edits only allowlisted nonsecret assignments, preserves unrelated settings (including existing session-secret delivery), and clears stale managed values. Keep `SESSION_SECRET` stable and delivered through the deployment's existing secure mechanism. The helper never copies provider keys, AWS credentials or signing secrets from the build environment. See [transcription configuration](../../docs/TRANSCRIPTION.md) for speech settings.

Public links expire after seven days; owner history and underlying records do not. The table disables legacy `expiresAt` TTL, and new writes omit it. Review/apply that change before deploying this retention policy against any existing table; previously deleted records cannot be recovered, and in-flight service deletions may continue after disabling TTL. There is no manual delete endpoint, backup or account recovery. See [data lifecycle](../../docs/DATA_GLOSSARY.md#app-data-lifecycle).

For local database tests, start DynamoDB Local on port 8000 and run `DYNAMODB_LOCAL_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000 npm run test:dynamodb`. The shared repository contract covers both adapters; the integration suite additionally exercises pagination/order/conditional writes. Default `npm test` requires no database or provider credentials. Database-backed HTTP tests cover owner isolation, public-link expiry, retained private access and response projection. GSI visibility checks use bounded polling; immediate read-after-write assertions apply only to detail reads.

Before rollout, test the actual Amplify adapter, runtime role credentials, stable cookies, owner isolation, public-link expiration and delayed history visibility in development. A passing local build does not establish hosting compatibility. No live AWS validation is claimed here.

DynamoDB is on-demand; request and retained table/index storage costs grow with usage. Check current regional rates. There is no retention-based storage bound. Rolling back to memory hides durable history and makes new saves disposable; it is not a migration. Preserve the table and stable signing key during compatible code rollbacks. Table destruction permanently deletes private history; production deletion protection must be deliberately disabled in a reviewed plan first.

## Bounded history

The API returns at most 20 shares by default (maximum requested limit 50). The client follows `X-Next-Cursor` only after an explicit Load more action; a database size boundary can produce a smaller page. Cursors are private positions, not authorization credentials. Each query reconstructs its owner partition from the verified session. See [the API contract](../../docs/API.md#list-private-shares) for request/response details. Pagination is not a consistent snapshot across concurrent writes or index propagation; the UI deduplicates repeated IDs and refresh starts again from the newest page.

## Daily reading catalog

The shared root provisions a private, encrypted, versioned S3 bucket and one `just-for-today.yaml` object. The compute role receives only `s3:GetObject` for that exact object. `runtime_environment` outputs `READINGS_SOURCE=s3`, `READINGS_S3_BUCKET`, `READINGS_S3_KEY`, and `READINGS_REGION` for the shared runtime preparation command. DynamoDB continues to store shares.

The YAML is a top-level list of `date`, `title`, `quote`, `source`, and `body`. `READINGS_SAMPLE` controls fictional-content labeling outside the YAML. The required `readings_yaml_path` lives in each environment tfvars file. The checked-in files explicitly select fictional `readings.example.yaml`; replace the path with the complete licensed catalog before a real deployment. Ordinary plans use the same persistent selection. Terraform validates dates, duplicate dates, quotation/source fields and text bounds before publishing the object; edits replace the whole publication. The runtime validates the complete YAML again before caching it. Prior S3 versions remain recoverable. No AWS apply is part of application builds.

Both S3 and local-file loading use the same process-local catalog cache. See [YAML format, publication, timezone and cache behavior](../../docs/READINGS.md).
